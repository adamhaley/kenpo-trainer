This is a simple app to help you work through the material of Kenpo Karate. 
You can load up practice sessions based on what you want to work on  that day.
Create sessions from the material of individual belts to prepare for a test, find techniques by category, or just load up the whole system.
Then go through your session in order, or load the next technique in the session at random.

Work in progress.
